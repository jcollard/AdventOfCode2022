# The Beginner's Guide to Advent of Code 2022

**Hello Coders!**

I am a believer that the Advent of Code is for *EVERYONE*! It is an excellent way to 
practice your problem solving skills, collaborate with others, and LEARN.

## tl;dr

I created video guides to help beginner programmers develop an approach to Part
1 of each puzzle. The videos can be found at the end of this writeup!

## The Long Version

As I was attempting to encourage young programmers to check it out, I received
quite a bit of criticism saying that "Only a few of the puzzles can be solved by
new programmers.". This is *NOT* true at all!

In fact, I believe that many of the puzzles can be completed using the
concepts taught in my Intro to Coding course:

* Variables
* String Manipulation
* Functions
* Boolean Logic
* Arrays / Lists
* Multidimensional Arrays
* Loops
* Composite Data Structures (Classes / Structs / Algebraic Data Types)

The most challenging part of these puzzles is often just figuring out what the
heck you are supposed to do. If you can figure this out, you have a chance!

To help encourage and help my own students to tackle these puzzles, I decided to
create the **Beginner's Guide**. Thus far, I have completed a guide for days 1 -
14. I intend to create guides for the remaining days. That said, a few of the
days (16 and 17 as of writing) will not be **Beginner Guides** and instead will
likely have their own little "series" to break down more advanced algorithmic
concepts.

Each video is designed to break down the "computational thinking" part of the
puzzle without giving away the implementation. In essence, help them develop an
approach to the problem. The guide then proceeds step by step through this
approach and encourages uses to pause, write tests, and implement each step
before continuing.

## The Guides

In the guides, I happen to use C# as my implementation language BUT provide a
high level approach that *SHOULD* be approachable in just about any language.
The goal here isn't to show a solution in C# but instead guide a beginner
through the process in their own language.
